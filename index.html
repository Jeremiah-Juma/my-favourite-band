        <p>sauti sol is my favourite band because it among the few band in kenya that have stayed together for about 16years with out braking.</p>
        <p>They are among the few band in africa playing music in african way.</p>
        <p>I see them promote africa as a whole continet in their music hence they are just ambassadors of africa.</p>
